## Decision making systems
This project contains small python programs created to illustrate global optimization methods

### Global optimization via Monte Carlo method
Task: f(x1, x2) -> min on D = {x1,x2: x1 in [a1, b1], x2 in [a2, b2]} using classic monte carlo method.
In program we can set a1,b1, a2,b2 and amout of testing points.
Gui program located in monte-carlo module.

### Monte Carlo method experiment
The goal is to calculte error of method, then build some grafics depending on amount of experiments
